                <h3>It Takes A Village To Raise A City</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                    Envision yourself in the Manhattan of yesteryear. 
                    The landscape is predominantly residential row houses, with an intertwined network of carriage-sized streets, and the tallest structure is a two-storied courthouse mainly due to its clock tower.  
                    Your possibly idea of a New York as an ever-expanding endless menagerie of business and skyscrapers might cause you to question such a place remaining in existence. 
                    Say hello to Greenwich Village. 
                    Greenwich Village dates back to the time when New York was a Dutch settlement and is one of the first areas designated a historic landmark. 
                    Unfortunately, some of its 18th century visual appeal was demolished to create the avenues of the Manhattan grid system. 
                    Nevertheless, Greenwich holds onto its quaint charm with its tiny zigzag named streets. 
                    This neighborhood also has a reputation for progressive thinkers and is home to several important events in numerous counter-cultural movements. 
                    Be sure to visit places like the Stonewall Inn and Washington Square Park, where some of these moments in history took place.
                    
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    
                    You can talk about Greenwich Village without mentioning entertainment and there are definitely some highly notable venues throughout this area. 
                    However, <a href="https://www.smallslive.com"><strong>Smalls Jazz Club</strong></a> has a piecemeal ragtag appeal more reflective of its surroundings than some other musical forums. 
                    Furthermore, entertainment locales such as the <a href="http://www.comedycellar.com"><strong>Comedy Cellar</strong></a>, a compact subterranean comedy club with dramatically unpredictable line-ups, and <a href="http://www.ifccenter.com"><strong>IFC Center</strong></a>, a film house gem showcasing the latest and greatest in independent film, 
                        should round out your list of can&#39;t miss activities. 
                    There is literally a myriad of restaurants that will keep your belly full no matter what your taste. 
                    Check out <a href="http://twoboots.com"><strong>Two Boots</strong></a> pizzeria for some of the best most creative pizza in all of the country. 
                    Then take a walk along Bleecker Street to sustenance shopping fix. 
                    Where everything from the highest to lowest end in fashion can be found. 
                    This meandering street is definitely welcomed alternative to New York's often congested fashion districts. 
                    Greenwich Village is the last vestige of traditional Manhattan culture, which New York largely gets its notable prestige. 
                    One visit here and you will witness why this is one of most coveted neighborhoods in the entire city.
