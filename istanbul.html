                    A city this old is bound to have a landmark or two. 
                    The Sultanahmet district managed to squeeze a bunch of them all within approximately a city block from each other. 
                    The Sultanahmet district, for centuries, was the cultural center of city hosting everything from political events, monarchial ceremonies, and even chariot races. 
                    It only makes sense that some of the best of what Istanbul has to offer is here. 
                    Now since your entire trip could be encompassed by the activities available here, we will give you a few options as to what should be at the top of your list.

                    What better place to witness Istanbuls dynamic past than <a href="http://ayasofyamuzesi.gov.tr/en"><strong>Hagia Sophia</strong></a>. 
                    Throughout its existence it has served as a church, a mosque, and now a museum. 
                    It is as if no ruling body in Turkey could keep their hands off this incredible structure. 
                    In fact, you can still see remnants of mosaics depicting various Christian figures directly adjacent to plaques with Islamic texts all nestled under one extremely impressive dome (one of the best examples of Byzantine architecture). 
                    With todays religious climate, the world could definitely use examples of this kind of coexistence.

                   Next door to Hagia Sophia is the Ottoman Empire's longest used place of residence <a href="http://topkapisarayi.gov.tr/en"><strong>Topkapi Palace</strong></a>.
                   Topkapi Palace was like a city within a city housing not only Sultan and his harem of women but also everything from a mint to a hospital and believe it or not several bakeries. 
                   It contains historic garments, weaponry, pottery, jewels, Islamic calligraphy and murals from 600 years of Ottoman rule. 
                   The grounds are equally amazing with panoramic views of the city, luscious gardens, and beautifully decorated rooms. 
                   This palace is one of the most incredible displays of the great opulence of the Ottoman Empire. 
                   Topkapi Palace is a great place to peek inside the life of the former monarchy making it well worth a visit.

                    Rome All Throughout The City   
                    
                </h3>
                
                <p>
                    Some of the best example of Istanbul&#39;s former Roman glory can also be found in the Sultanahmet district. 
                    It is widely known that the Romans were seemingly obsessed with city planning and massive sporting arenas. 
                    The Hippodrome and Basilica Cistern are two interesting structures that illustrate components of that tradition. 
                    The information about there historical usage, dismantling, and rediscovery can shed light on a world often forgotten. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Hippodrome served as one of the most vital sociopolitical center of the former imperial city. 
                    It defined a rare opportunity for the Emperor to indirectly interact with the general public. 
                    This gave the Hippodrome, and the events within it, grave importance to the daily lives of all the inhabitants of the capital. 
                    Chariot racing teams became intertwined with political positions, which at its most extreme lead to riots and massacres. 
                    Despite its cultural significance, very few elements of the Hippodrome remain. 
                    During the Fourth Crusade, what was not destroyed during the conquest of the city was left in ruins and anything of considered wealth was plundered. 
                    Later, the Ottoman Empire had little to no interest in the building so they neglected and dismantled it throughout there reign. 
                    It was until the 20th century that it was rediscovered and once again appreciated. 
                    You should make time to visit the remaining structural elements and obelisks, which now sit amongst a newly built fountain and park. 
                    There are also several archeological museums that house some of the revived artifacts of this once grand structure.
