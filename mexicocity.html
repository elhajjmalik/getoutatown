               <h3>The Mexican Triple-Threat</h3>
               
               <p>
                  One of the best visual representations of Mexico&#39;s diverse cultural history is Palacio de Bellas Artes. 
                  All forms of Mexican artistic expression are exhibits here on the grandest scale. 
                  The building alone is an art nouveau masterpiece of architecture. 
                  The exterior is wrapped in gorgeous Italian white marble while each bevel is beautifully crafted to create a graphic description of prominence and distinction. 
                  Three fantastic domes affixed to the roof act like a crowning achievement of design.
                  It is arguably the most stunning buildings in all of Mexico. Creatively, the interior design makes a stylistically deviation from the exterior. 
                  Art deco is the prevalent style here and symbolic structural elements are placed adjoining Mesoamerican deities. 
                  The works of several famous muralists dominant the walls of the main plaza with Diego Rivera decommissioned Rockefeller Center mural as its centerpiece. 
                  There are also several exhibition halls and section dedicated to architecture. 
                  Then there is the performance hall, where various eloquent theatrical presentations can be viewed the best of which is the Ballet Folklorico de Mexico. 
                  Unfortunately, most everything is communicated solely in Spanish. 
                  If you do not know the language, you will have to search for more information on translated websites about time and dates for specific <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com.mx/Palacio-De-Bellas-Artes-boletos-Mexico/venue/163844"><strong>performances</strong></a>.  
                  Nonetheless, do not let a language barrier prohibit you from taking in this wonderful hodgepodge of architecture, visual, and performance arts.

                    If you were boy growing up in the 1980s or 1990s you will probably remember how remarkable professional wrestling was. 
                    What you may not know is that the highflying acrobatic style we all know and love can largely be attributed to Mexico. 
                    La Lucha Libre is the Mexican version of professional freestyle wrestling. 
                    It is a visual aerial barrage of athletes catapulting themselves into one another.  
                    Performing amazing pins and maneuvers at lightning speeds.
                    The history of Mexican wrestling originated in 1863, when the first Mexican wrestler invented the rules and regulations of La Lucha Libre. 
                    And in the 1940s, the sport would find its first superstars in the legendary masked characters known as El Santo and Blue Demon. 
                    Their fame transcended wrestling commercially and even politically, as they became symbols for the trials and tribulations of Mexican life. 
                    The masks cannot even be explained in its massive importance. 
                    Just know it is absolutely critical to La Lucha Libre. 
                    Some well-known wrestlers have never even been seen in public without their masks. 
                    If you see one of the wrestling messing with it, be sure that some thing interesting is about to happen.

                <h3>My Park Is Better Than Your Park</h3>
                
                
                <p>
                   Mexico City is gargantuan. 
                   It is the tenth largest city in the world by population for goodness sake. 
                   In fact, more people speak Spanish here than any city in Spain. 
                   How do Mexicans escape in the largest city the western hemisphere? 
                   They built the largest urban park in the western hemisphere. 
                   Chapultepec is, quite frankly, the most eclectic park in all the Americas. 
                   Even Aztec emperors used it as a retreat. 
                   There is so much land and so many attractions that the park has to be separated into three digestible sections. 
                   The National Museum of Anthropology, Chapultepec Castle and Zoo, and Lago Menor are in the first section. 
                   They are probably the most noteworthy attractions of the park but they amongst several others. 
                   
                   <br><br>

                   <br><br>
                   
                   The <a href="http://www.mna.inah.gob.mx/tu-visita/plan-your-visit.html"><strong>National Museum of Anthropology</strong></a> covers 44,000 square meters, yeah its huge too, and it houses the entire scope of what is known about pre-Columbian Mesoamerican heritage. 
                   Other than being on one of the most historically significant sites of the Aztec empire, <a href="http://gomexico.about.com/od/mexicocity/p/national-history-museum.htm"><strong>Chapultepec Castle</a></strong> an tumultuously changing building that has been converted from a royal residence to a national museum. 
                   It now displays post-Columbian artifacts and bestows great vista of Mexico City. 
                   At <a href="http://www.mexicocity-guide.com/attractions/zoo.htm"><strong>Chapultepec Zoo</strong></a>, some of Mexico most rare creatures can be found amongst a wide assortment of indigenous animals and is definitely the most visited attraction in the park. 
                   Or you can escape the hordes people all together in a rented boat and traverse the calm tranquil waters of Lago Menor, meaning small lake. 
                   If you have anytime left, the second section has an amazing amusement park, the Feria de Chapultepec, with several flat rides and roller coasters. 
                   While the third section is largely reserved for animals so you skip it unless the other two sections did not indulge your appetite for park.
